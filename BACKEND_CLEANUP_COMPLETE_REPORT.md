## 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT IMPACT

### Docker Image Optimization

**Before Cleanup**:
```dockerfile
# Would copy all files including 46 unnecessary ones
COPY . .
```

**After Cleanup**:
```dockerfile
# Only copy what's needed
COPY server.js .
COPY package*.json .
COPY models/ ./models/
COPY routes/ ./routes/
COPY services/ ./services/
COPY middleware/ ./middleware/
# Exclude archive-scripts/ automatically
```

**Estimated Size Reduction**: ~400KB

### Deployment Benefits
