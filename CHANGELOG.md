## Security Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Security Features
- Passwords hashed with bcryptjs (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes in production)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CORS protection
- Security headers via Helmet.js

### Known Security Considerations
- Default JWT secret should be changed in production
- Database passwords should be strong in production
- HTTPS should be enforced in production
- Regular security updates should be applied

## Migration Notes

### From JSON to Database
The application supports seamless migration from JSON file storage to PostgreSQL:
1. Data structure is compatible between modes
2. Migration scripts available for data transfer
3. Zero-downtime switching supported

### Environment Migration
- Development uses `.env.development`
- Production requires environment-specific configuration
- All sensitive data should be in environment variables

## Performance Notes

### Optimizations Included
- Database connection pooling
- Efficient SQL queries with proper indexes
- Gzip compression for API responses
- Static file serving optimization
- React component optimization

### Recommended Production Optimizations
- Enable PostgreSQL query optimization
- Set up Redis for session management
- Configure CDN for static assets
- Enable database connection pooling
- Set up monitoring and logging
