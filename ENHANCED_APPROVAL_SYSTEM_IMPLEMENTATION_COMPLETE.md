  - `/api/approval/pending` - Get pending approvals for current user role
  - `/api/approval/history` - Get approval history with filtering
  - `/api/approval/stats` - Get approval statistics and metrics
  - `/api/approval/rab/:id/submit` - Submit RAB for enhanced approval workflow
  - `/api/approval/rab/:id/status` - Get detailed RAB approval status
  - `/api/approval/:id/action` - Process approval actions (approve/reject/request info)

### Phase 4: Frontend Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
- Enhanced RABApprovalStatus component with construction industry workflow support
- Created EnhancedApprovalDashboard with role-based interface
- Added SLA progress tracking with visual indicators
- Implemented approval action processing with comments
