## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Final Verification
```bash
# Verify build
cd /root/APP-YK/frontend
docker exec nusantara-frontend sh -c "cd /app && npm run build"

# Check bundle size
ls -lh build/static/js/main.*.js

# Verify no errors
grep -i "error" build_output.log
```
**Expected:** Build success, bundle ~463 KB, no errors

#### Step 2: Database Backup
```bash
# Backup database
docker exec nusantara-db pg_dump -U postgres yk_construction_dev > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup
ls -lh backup_*.sql
```
**Expected:** Backup file created successfully

#### Step 3: Git Commit
```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete modularization of all 8 modules - v2.0.0"
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```
**Expected:** Changes committed and tagged

### Phase 2: Deployment (30 minutes)

#### Step 4: Stop Services
```bash
# Stop frontend container
docker-compose stop frontend

# Verify stopped
docker ps | grep nusantara-frontend
```
**Expected:** Frontend container stopped

#### Step 5: Deploy New Code
```bash
# Pull latest changes (if remote deployment)
git pull origin main

# Rebuild frontend
docker-compose build frontend

# Restart services
docker-compose up -d frontend
```
**Expected:** Services restarted successfully

#### Step 6: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep nusantara-frontend

# Check logs
docker logs nusantara-frontend --tail 100

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000
```
**Expected:** Container running, no errors, service responding

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment (20 minutes)

#### Step 7: Smoke Tests

- [ ] ProjectDetail displays correctly
- [ ] ProjectRABWorkflow functional
- [ ] TandaTerimaManager works properly
- [ ] ProjectTeam displays and edits
- [ ] ProjectMilestones operational
- [ ] Navigation between modules works
- [ ] API calls successful

#### Step 8: Performance Verification
```bash
# Check bundle size
ls -lh /root/APP-YK/frontend/build/static/js/main.*.js

# Monitor memory usage
docker stats nusantara-frontend --no-stream

# Check response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:3000
```
**Expected:** Bundle ~463 KB, normal memory, fast response
