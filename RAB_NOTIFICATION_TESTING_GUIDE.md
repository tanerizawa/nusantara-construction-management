## üîç Verification Commands

### Check FCM Tokens
```bash
docker exec nusantara-postgres psql -U admin -d nusantara_construction \
  -c "SELECT user_id, device_type, is_active, created_at::date FROM notification_tokens WHERE is_active = true;"
```

### Check Recent RAB Items
```bash
docker exec nusantara-postgres psql -U admin -d nusantara_construction \
  -c "SELECT id, description, status, created_by, created_at FROM project_rab ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No Notifications Received

**Symptom:** Created RAB but no notification appears

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check FCM Token Registered**
   ```bash
   docker exec nusantara-postgres psql -U admin -d nusantara_construction \
     -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notification_tokens WHERE is_active = true;"
   ```
   If returns 0: User needs to login and allow notifications

2. **Check Browser Permission**
   - Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Notifications
   - Should show `localhost:3000` as "Allowed"

   - Go to site settings ‚Üí reset notifications

2. **Check Notification UI**
   - Look for bell icon in header
   - Check notification dropdown
   - Might need to refresh page

3. **Check Console for Errors**
