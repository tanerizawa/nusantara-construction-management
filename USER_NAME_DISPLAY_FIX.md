# ✅ USER NAME DISPLAY FIX - Timeline Kegiatan

**Date**: October 13, 2025, 01:05 WIB  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**  
**Issue**: User names not displaying in activity timeline

---

## 🐛 Problem Found

### Root Cause:
Backend query used **wrong column name** for users table:
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG (column doesn't exist)
SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ?

-- ✅ CORRECT (users.profile is JSONB)
SELECT profile->>'fullName' as name, username FROM users WHERE id = ?
```

### Users Table Structure:
```
users:
  - id (VARCHAR)
  - username (VARCHAR)
  - email (VARCHAR)
  - profile (JSONB)  ← Contains {"fullName": "Hadez", "position": "...", ...}
```

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Activities Performer Name Query
**File**: `backend/routes/projects/milestoneDetail.routes.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = :userId
```

**After**:
```javascript
SELECT profile->>'fullName' as name, username FROM users WHERE id = :userId
```

**Fallback**: If `fullName` is null, use `username`

### 2. Cost User Trail Queries
**File**: `backend/routes/projects/milestoneDetail.routes.js`

**Before**:
```sql
SELECT 
  u1.name as recorded_by_name,
  u2.name as updated_by_name,
  u3.name as deleted_by_name
FROM milestone_costs c
LEFT JOIN users u1 ON c.recorded_by = u1.id
```

**After**:
```sql
SELECT 
  COALESCE(u1.profile->>'fullName', u1.username) as recorded_by_name,
  COALESCE(u2.profile->>'fullName', u2.username) as updated_by_name,
  COALESCE(u3.profile->>'fullName', u3.username) as deleted_by_name
FROM milestone_costs c
LEFT JOIN users u1 ON c.recorded_by = u1.id
```

**Result**: Now returns "Hadez" instead of NULL ✅

## 🧪 Verification

### Test Query Result:
```sql
SELECT 
  c.cost_category, 
  c.amount,
  COALESCE(u.profile->>'fullName', u.username) as recorded_by_name
FROM milestone_costs c
LEFT JOIN users u ON c.recorded_by = u.id
WHERE c.milestone_id = '818f6da6-efe7-4480-b157-619a04e6c2e5'
ORDER BY c.recorded_at DESC;

Results:
materials   | 10000000.00  | Hadez ✅
contingency | 1000000000.00| Hadez ✅
labor       | 7000000.00   | Hadez ✅
```

```sql
SELECT 
  ma.activity_title,
  ma.performed_at,
  COALESCE(u.profile->>'fullName', u.username) as performer
FROM milestone_activities ma
LEFT JOIN users u ON ma.performed_by = u.id
WHERE ma.milestone_id = '818f6da6-efe7-4480-b157-619a04e6c2e5'
