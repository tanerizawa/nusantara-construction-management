# ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: User Trail for Activity Timeline

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Confusing):
```
💰 Cost entry (deleted)  ← Who deleted? When? Why?
```

### After (Clear):
```
💰 Cost: Rp 1.000.000.000 by John Doe     ← Active cost, shows creator
💰̶ Deleted by Admin User                   ← Deleted cost, shows who deleted
```

---

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. Database ✅
Added tracking columns to `milestone_costs`:
- `updated_by` - Who updated
- `deleted_by` - Who deleted
- `deleted_at` - When deleted (soft delete)

### 2. Backend ✅
- **Soft Delete**: Data preserved when deleted
- **User Trail**: Track creator, updater, deleter
- **Activity Log**: Auto-create "cost_deleted" activity
- **Filter**: Exclude deleted costs from summaries

### 3. Frontend ✅
- Show creator name: "Cost: Rp X by John Doe"
- Show deleter name: "Deleted by Admin User"
- Tooltips with full details
- Clear visual distinction
