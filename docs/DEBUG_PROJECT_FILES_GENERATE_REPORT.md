## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Clear Cache & Reload
```bash
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard reload)
2. Or F12 → Application → Clear storage → Clear site data
3. Reload page
```

### Test Project Files
```javascript
1. Click "Project Files" button
2. Check Console (F12) for these logs:
   ✓ Quick Action triggered: open-files
   ✓ Opening documents tab...
   ? Active tab changed to: documents  ← Look for this
   ? Rendering ProjectDocuments component  ← And this

3. Check if URL hash changes:
   Expected: #documents

4. Check if Documents tab content appears
```

### Test Generate Report
```javascript
1. Click "Generate Report" button
2. Check Console for these logs:
   ✓ Quick Action triggered: generate-report

   Expected: #reports

4. Check if Report Generator form appears inline
```

## 🔍 Diagnostic Checks

### If "Active tab changed to" doesn't appear:

**Possible Issues**:
1. State not updating (React issue)
2. Component re-render blocked
3. Old JavaScript cached

**Solutions**:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check React DevTools → Components → ProjectDetail → State
- Clear all browser cache

---

### If "Rendering ProjectDocuments" doesn't appear:

**Possible Issues**:
1. `activeTab` is not 'documents'
2. `project` is null/undefined
3. Condition `{activeTab === 'documents' && project && ...}` fails

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Add this in browser console:
console.log('activeTab:', activeTab);
console.log('project:', project);
console.log('Match:', activeTab === 'documents');
```

---

### If Component Renders but Nothing Shows:

**Possible Issues**:
1. ProjectDocuments component has internal error
2. CSS hiding the content
3. Data not loaded

**Check**:
- Browser console for React errors
- Network tab for API calls
- React DevTools for component props

---

## 📝 Current Investigation

### Evidence So Far:
- ✅ Button click works
- ✅ Handler executes
- ✅ setActiveTab('documents') called
- ⏳ Need to confirm: State actually changes
- ⏳ Need to confirm: Component renders

### Next Debug Steps:

**Step 1**: Verify state change
```
Look for: "Active tab changed to: documents"
```

**Step 2**: Verify component render
```
Look for: "Rendering ProjectDocuments component"
```

**Step 3**: Check URL hash
```
Should be: #documents
```

**Step 4**: Check visible content
```
Should see: Documents tab content
```

## 🚀 Action Items

### For User:
1. ✅ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. ⏳ Click "Project Files" button
3. ⏳ Copy ALL console output and share
4. ⏳ Take screenshot of what appears (or doesn't)
5. ⏳ Check browser URL - does hash change?

### Look For These Logs:
```javascript
✓ Quick Action triggered: open-files         // You saw this
✓ Opening documents tab...                   // You saw this
? Active tab changed to: documents           // Should see now
? Rendering ProjectDocuments component       // Should see now
```

## 💡 Quick Diagnostic

**If you see all 4 logs but nothing renders:**
- Component exists but content is hidden/broken
- Check for React errors in console
- Check if data is loaded

**If you see only 2 logs (current situation):**
- State might not be updating
- Need to verify with new logs
- Hard refresh required

**If you see 3 logs (state changed but no render):**
- Rendering condition failing
- Check `project` object exists
- Check tab ID spelling

---

**Next**: Please share the NEW console output after hard refresh!

We should see 2 additional log lines if everything works correctly.
