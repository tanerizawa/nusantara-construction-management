## Established Architecture Patterns

### 1. Hooks Structure
```
hooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ useMain[Feature].js         # Primary business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ use[Feature]Form.js         # Form state management  
â”œâ”€â”€ use[Feature]Modal.js        # Modal state management
â”œâ”€â”€ use[Feature]Filters.js      # Search/filtering logic
â””â”€â”€ use[Feature]Operations.js   # Complex operations
```

### 2. Components Structure  
```
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ [Feature]Header.js          # Header with actions
â”œâ”€â”€ [Feature]Summary.js         # Summary/stats display
â”œâ”€â”€ [Feature]List.js           # Main data display
â”œâ”€â”€ [Feature]Item.js           # Individual list items
â”œâ”€â”€ [Feature]Modal.js          # Modal dialogs
â””â”€â”€ [Feature]Form.js           # Form components
```

### 3. Configuration Structure
```
config/
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]Config.js         # Main configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]Types.js          # Type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]FormConfig.js     # Form configurations
â””â”€â”€ [feature]Constants.js      # Constants/enums
```

### 4. Services Structure
```
services/
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]Service.js        # Primary API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]Api.js           # API endpoints
â””â”€â”€ [related]Service.js       # Related entity APIs
```

### 5. Utils Structure
```
utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]Calculations.js   # Business calculations
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]Helpers.js       # Helper functions
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature]Validation.js    # Validation logic
â””â”€â”€ [feature]Export.js        # Export functionality
```

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Zero Breaking Changes
- All modularized components maintain identical APIs
- Drop-in replacements for original files
- Existing imports continue to work
- No impact on other parts of the application

### 2. Configuration-Driven Design
- Centralized configuration files for easy customization
- Consistent styling and behavior patterns
- Easy to modify without code changes
- Environment-specific configurations

### 3. Custom Hooks Pattern
- Business logic extracted into reusable hooks
- Clean separation between logic and presentation
- Easy to test and maintain
- Promotes code reuse across components

### 4. Service Layer Abstraction
- Clean API abstraction with error handling
- Consistent response format across services
- Easy to mock for testing
- Centralized API endpoint management

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Backup Originals
All original files backed up with `.backup.modularization` extension:
- `SubsidiaryEdit.js.backup.modularization`
- `InvoiceManager.js.backup.modularization`  
- `PurchaseOrderWorkflow.js.backup.modularization`
- `ChartOfAccounts.js.backup.modularization`

### 2. Progressive Replacement
Each original file replaced with simple import/export:
```javascript
import ModularComponent from './ComponentName/ComponentName';
export default ModularComponent;
```

### 3. Folder Organization
Each modularized component gets its own folder:
```
src/components/[ComponentName]/
â”œâ”€â”€ [ComponentName].js          # Main component
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js                   # Clean exports
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/                     # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ components/                # UI components  
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                    # Configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ services/                  # API calls
â””â”€â”€ utils/                     # Helper functions
```

## Next Steps & Recommendations
