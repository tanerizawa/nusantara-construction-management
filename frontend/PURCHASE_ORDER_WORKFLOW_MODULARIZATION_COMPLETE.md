## 🎯 Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Custom Hooks Pattern**
- `usePurchaseOrderData`: Data fetching and management
- `usePOWorkflowNavigation`: View state and navigation logic
- `usePOFilters`: Filter state and summary calculations
- `useRABItems`: RAB items loading and management
- `usePOForm`: Form state, validation, and submission

### 2. **View-Based Architecture**
- **PurchaseOrderListView**: Main dashboard with statistics and filters
- **ProjectSelectionView**: Project selection for new PO creation
- **CreatePOView**: Comprehensive PO creation form
- **PODetailView**: Professional printable PO document

### 3. **Component Composition**
- **Atomic Components**: POCard, POStatusFilter, POSummaryCards
- **Form Components**: SupplierInfoForm, RABItemSelector
- **Layout Components**: POList, NavigationBreadcrumb, POSummarySection

### 4. **Configuration-Driven Design**
- **Status Management**: `PO_STATUS`, `STATUS_CONFIG`
- **View Constants**: `VIEWS`, `FILTER_OPTIONS`
- **Company Info**: `COMPANY_INFO`, `PO_TERMS`
- **UI Configuration**: `SUMMARY_CONFIG`, `APPROVAL_ROLES`

### 5. **Service Layer Separation**
- **API Calls**: Centralized in `poAPI.js`
- **Business Logic**: Extracted to `poUtils.js`
- **Configuration**: Separated into `poConfig.js`

## 🔧 Key Features Modularized
