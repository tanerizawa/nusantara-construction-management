# Chart.js Modularization Complete

## Overview
The `Chart.js` file has been successfully modularized into a structured directory with individual components, utilities, and configuration files. This modularization improves maintainability, readability, and allows for easier extension of chart functionality.

## Original File
- Location: `/src/components/ui/Chart.js`
- Size: ~710 lines
- Features: Various charting components with mixed concerns (presentation, logic, formatting)

## New Structure
```
/src/components/ui/Chart/
├── components/
│   ├── ChartContainer.js
│   ├── BudgetChart.js
│   ├── MilestoneChart.js
│   ├── ProgressBudgetChart.js
│   ├── FinancialBarChart.js
│   ├── DistributionPieChart.js
│   ├── FinancialSummaryCard.js
│   ├── ComparisonBarChart.js
│   ├── TimeSeriesChart.js
│   └── PerformanceRadarChart.js
├── config/
│   └── chartConfig.js
├── utils/
│   └── chartUtils.js
└── index.js
```

## Key Improvements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each chart component is now in its own file
2. **Centralized Configuration**: Chart styles, colors, and constants are in `config/chartConfig.js`
3. **Reusable Utilities**: Formatting functions and calculations are in `utils/chartUtils.js`
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Original exports are preserved through the re-export stub
5. **Better Documentation**: Each component has proper JSDoc comments
6. **Enhanced Extensibility**: Easier to add new chart types or modify existing ones
7. **Simplified Testing**: Individual components are easier to test in isolation

## Components Added During Modularization
- `ComparisonBarChart`: Side-by-side bar chart for comparing metrics across categories
- `TimeSeriesChart`: Line chart for time series data with multiple series
- `FinancialSummaryCard`: Card displaying financial metrics with trends
- `PerformanceRadarChart`: Radar chart for multi-dimensional performance metrics
