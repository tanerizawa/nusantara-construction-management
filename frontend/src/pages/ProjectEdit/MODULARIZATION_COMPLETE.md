# ProjectEdit.js Modularization Complete

## Overview
The `ProjectEdit.js` file has been successfully modularized into a structured directory with individual components, custom hooks, and utility files. This modularization improves maintainability, readability, and allows for easier extension and testing of functionality.

## Original File
- Location: `/src/pages/ProjectEdit.js`
- Size: ~862 lines
- Features: Complex form handling for project editing with multiple sections

## New Structure
```
/src/pages/ProjectEdit/
├── components/
│   ├── AlertMessage.js
│   ├── BasicInfoSection.js
│   ├── ClientInfoSection.js
│   ├── FinancialSection.js
│   ├── FormActions.js
│   ├── LoadingState.js
│   ├── LocationSection.js
│   ├── PageHeader.js
│   ├── StatusSection.js
│   └── TimelineSection.js
├── hooks/
│   └── useProjectEditForm.js
├── utils/
├── index.js
└── ProjectEdit.js
```

## Key Improvements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each form section is now in its own component
2. **Custom Hooks**: Business logic is separated into a custom hook (`useProjectEditForm`)
3. **Reusable Components**: Components like `AlertMessage` and `LoadingState` can be reused elsewhere
4. **Modular Structure**: Clear organization makes it easier to find and modify specific parts
5. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain
6. **Easier Testing**: Components and hooks can be tested in isolation
7. **Better Code Navigation**: Organized directory structure improves code navigation

## Benefits
- Developers can now work on individual sections without affecting others
- Each component is focused on a single responsibility
- New form sections can be added without modifying existing code
- UI changes can be made without touching business logic
- Consistent styling and patterns across form sections
